And the catch is a pretty substantial one. So while you might be assuming my software dev skills are so top notch that I'm contributing to huge projects that are changing the world, enabling decentralisation and helping bank the unbanked... my [pull request](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/pull/882) is actually just fixing up a few sentences of the Ethereum website to make it read better.

But that's part of the beauty of open source projects, anyone can step in to help. Whether it's understanding the whole codebase or just fixing up sentence structure, contributing to open source helps moves the ecosystem forward.

So while it's not a huge change, I'ma celebrate anyway ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³
