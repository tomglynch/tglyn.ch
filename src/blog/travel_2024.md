My partner Milla and I spent most of 2024 having a look around. We saw lots. We kept our friends and family updated with an occasional email which automatically published to our [blog](https://tomandmilla.beehiiv.com/). Take a read!

I also gifted Milla a camera for her birthday just before the trip started, a Sony a6400. Her photography skills have multiplied and she's posted her best pics of our trip on [her photography page](https://millaphotos.myportfolio.com/).
