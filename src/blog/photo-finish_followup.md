THIS IS THE ENV: {{ env.environment }}




in light of blog post

research De Brabantse Pijl - demi vollering and ruth winder

In light of my previous blog post which gained about it a bit of traction and generated lots of discussion regarding the measurements involved in photo finishes I decided to have a look at other recent photo finishes to see if I could determine where the photo finish was set up. And whether it was in line with the actual finish line or not. Or not. Recent one that was mentioned in many comments was D branched appeal.

Aware


Demi volunteering, sprinted for the win and thought she had an insurmountable lead. As she took one hand off the Viet bars to begin celebrating as she crossed the line. Ruth winder was closing in at speed and in the photo finish photo was deemed to have one.

However, as per the footage from Astra gold

amsu gold. The further finish and the video camera at the finish seemed to contradict each other.

Thankfully, the D branch pill photofinish requires significantly less investigation than that of the Amstel gold race. As the race organizers have placed tape or painters squares, immediately after the finish line on one of the white bands as can be seen here. We can match these two up with the fighter finish.

As can be seen by the solid lines running horizontally

as the finish line is where the first white band meets the four centimeter black line. This means the photo finish for

the



event was taken at least four centimeters behind the actual finish from an estimate of the number of pixels containing the black line compared to the black dots on the white band. I estimate the black dots are roughly six centimeters wide. And since we know that the photofinish camera takes a photo of an narrow slit This slit could be focused at a point

four centimeters after the actual finish line or at the far end of the scale up to 10 centimeters behind the finish liner.

Given the closeness of the race, this could have resulted in a different outcome. While last time I was quite critical of the race organizers,

I think the issue at hand is more complicated. Photo finishes work best when the background is white, as it allows the timing the staff to see the exact outline of the front wheel of the cyclist as the leading edge of the cyclists tire is usually black tire

black tile on black

background would not be visible

Do you

in order to increase the accuracy of fader finishes. The UCI needs to implement specifications for how both the finish line is laid out and the photo finished camera is mounted and focused. The current specifications allow for too much

discrepancy between

the actual finish line and the photo finish

too.

Athletics manage to do this by having the finish line painted what what due to the distance of cycling events. The finish line needs to be painted much thicker than the finish line of cycling of athletics.

However,

I think it is necessary for the actual finish line of a cycling event to be watched as well. I would also suggest that the black markings on the leading edge of the white line finish line in athletics are necessary to ensure that the photo finished camera is perfectly aligned and within one to two centimeters of the actual finish line

due to the imperfections in the road surface that the finish line is set up on I do not believe there will be a more perfect way to do it than this. I propose The UCI swap from the current 34 centimeter white band, four centimeter black band, followed by another 34 centimeter white band

to instead use a 30 centimeter white band, followed by a four centimeter black band. Followed by a four centimeter white band followed by a four centimeter black band and if Followed by a 30 centimeter wide band The finish line here would be the leading edge of the A four centimeter wide band In the center On this Four centimeter white band on the leading edge

can be multiple black dots of one, two Two centimetres width that he used to ensure that the photo finish camera

is correctly in line. in consultation with photofinish camera, take emissions on what is the most vile Rule width for these black dots to be

UCI should mandate a maximum width

of these black dots If further finishes can be set up, where the black dots are only 50 are only half a centimeter So wired or fire millimeters wide. Then that should be the value They take by following this proposed finish line structure. This would significantly reduce any risks of The events of Amstel gold or Brands pills being repeated these events are not good for cycling. As they're bringing the results of the sport into disrepute To finish off, I call on UCI to look into The current issue Use involve Painted finish lines And take home board Part of My suggestion To ensure that These races Do Have a conclusive Final Result Smith Finally, I'd just like to add that there was a portion of commenters stating

That Why do I care? Yeah The result is there. Result We don't know To fix it However, These f lates However, with respect to the effort that these athletes put in, throughout their lives, to compete to be the best that they can be,

they're deserving for us to ensure that That the technology is there to accurately determine

best across the actual finish line. As Tom peacock said, this should only be racing for a single line. As Leon van Bom said it's so weird to find out that the finish is not the finish
