Having recently secured travel insurance through Freely for my adventures to Japan's cherry blossom season, New Zealand's winter ski trip, and Thailand's tropical beaches, I've become intimately familiar with this platform's workings.

## Introduction: Why I Chose Freely for International Travel Coverage

As someone who regularly travels internationally for both leisure and work, I found myself facing a common dilemma last year: how to find flexible travel insurance that allows mid-trip adjustments without excessive premiums or hidden exclusions. This quest led me to **Freely** - Australia's first app-based travel insurance platform I've since used to cover:

- **Japan** (March 2024 cherry blossom season)
- **New Zealand** (August 2024 ski trip to Queenstown)
- **Thailand** (December 2024 beach getaway)
- **Singapore** (February 2025 business conference)

But before committing to these policies (protecting over $15,000 AUD in pre-booked expenses), I conducted extensive due diligence. Here's everything you need to know about Freely's coverage options, user experiences, and why I now recommend it to fellow travelers **[using my referral code](https://www.freely.me/au/referred-friend?utm_source=growsurf&utm_medium=referral&grsf=mhiz6n)** for 15% off.

# Is Freely Safe? The Insurance Features That Won Me Over

## 1. Underwriting Credentials
Freely is backed by Hollard Insurance Company, an established insurer with an A- financial strength rating from AM Best. When I needed to make a claim for a canceled flight in Japan, their legitimate insurance infrastructure meant my reimbursement was processed efficiently - a reassuring quality check that demonstrated their commitment to policyholder protection.

## 2. Real-Time Policy Management
The platform allows you to **adjust your coverage while traveling**, only charging for the exact features you need when you need them:
1. Added winter sports coverage just before my spontaneous ski day in Queenstown
2. Increased my luggage protection when purchasing expensive souvenirs in Tokyo
3. Extended coverage by three days when I decided to stay longer in Thailand

This system protected me when I needed to modify my Singapore business trip last-minute - the app allowed seamless changes without cancellation penalties.

## 3. Claims Processing Framework
During my New Zealand trip, my rental car suffered minor damage from a parking incident. Freely's claims team:
- Allowed direct submission of photos via the app
- Processed the documentation within 48 hours
- Provided clear communication throughout
- Deposited reimbursement within 5 business days

The issue was sorted with minimal stress through their digital claims system.

# Frequently Asked Questions About Freely

### Is Freely legitimate travel insurance?
Based on my experiences, Freely is absolutely legitimate. It's underwritten by Hollard Insurance Company (rated A- by AM Best) and complies with all Australian insurance regulations. I've successfully made claims that were promptly paid, and their 24/7 emergency assistance proved invaluable during a medical consultation in Japan. Remember, you can save 15% on your policy using the referral link in my post.

### How does Freely's app-based system work?
From what I've experienced, the app is the control center for your entire policy. You can purchase insurance, view documents offline, add coverage modules, extend your travel dates, and even submit claims with photos directly through the interface. During my Thailand trip, I extended my coverage by three days with just a few taps, and the additional premium was calculated instantly.

### Can you really change your policy while traveling?
In my experience, yes - this is Freely's standout feature. While in New Zealand, I spontaneously decided to ski for a day and was able to add winter sports coverage that morning through the app. The additional premium was minimal for the single day I needed it. This flexibility means you're not stuck paying for coverage you don't need for your entire trip.

### What are Freely's fees and pricing structure?
When I used Freely, I found their pricing refreshingly transparent. The base policy includes essential medical coverage, and you add modules like luggage protection, rental car excess, or activity coverage as needed. There are no hidden administration fees, and when I extended my Thailand trip by three days, I was charged the exact pro-rated amount for the additional time. You can reduce costs further with the 15% discount you receive when you use the referral link in my post.

### Does Freely cover pre-existing conditions?
Freely automatically covers many stable pre-existing conditions, which I appreciated as someone with mild asthma. For my condition, I didn't need to pay any additional premium. However, they do require disclosure of all medical conditions during the application process, and some conditions may require additional premium or might not be coverable. I'd recommend being completely honest during the application process.

### What happens if you need to make a claim with Freely?
Freely's claims process is primarily app-based, which I found efficient when claiming for rental car damage in New Zealand. I submitted photos of the damage, the rental agreement, and repair invoice directly through the app. Their team acknowledged my claim within hours, requested one additional document the next day, and had my reimbursement processed within 5 business days. If you're planning a trip, you might as well save 15% by using the referral link in my post.
