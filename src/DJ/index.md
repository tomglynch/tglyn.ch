### Surf the Soundwaves with DJ Tom vs the Internet

{% assign spiel = "Hey, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹ and over the past four years, I've developed a way of live-mixing videos straight from the internet. 

Audiences call it indescribable, so check out some of my highlights below, or on [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@tomvstheinternet) to get a feel for what I do. And I'll try to explain in words anyway:

My **'Tom vs the Internet'** project is half DJ, half interactive performance art â€” it's all live in the browser, and I'm projecting my screen so the audience can follow along with what I'm doing!" %}

{% assign spiel2 = "It's like watching your friend click through YouTube videos, but as they switch tabs, the audio blends smoothly, turning it into a danceable experience. It's a real-time tapestry of sound and visuals, a live DJ set fused with a wide range of visuals from the internet through the browser.

I mix tracks but also get creative in involving the audience; so while they groove to the music, we can play a game of Wordle, join me on the projector via Zoom call, or leave the stage and have a Beyblade battle. Always getting the crowd involved!

I also mix in nostalgic videos from your childhood, iconic TV ads. It's the internet like you've never experienced â€” where digital content meets the dance floor. As I mentioned earlier, words don't do it justice, so [have a watch:](https://vimeo.com/onlinetom/highlightsreel)" %}
